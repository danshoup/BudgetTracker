## Creating an Online/Offline Budget Tracker

This is the nineteenth assignment for the MSU Coding Bootcamp; To add the functionality to our budget tracking app so we can allow for offline access and still save and update budget data when back online, and to deploy it on Heroku.  Using Mongoose with a Mongo database, and Express router, the app will also utilize MongoDB Atlas.

The app allows a user to track an online budget. The user can add expenses and deposits to the budget whether the app is online or offline.  The offline transactions will populate the total when brought back online.
